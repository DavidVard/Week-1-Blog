                                                          Html Project

This project was extremely difficult and frustrating, especially for someone like me who took classes in C++ and java. I found it to be difficult because the last time I coded was roughly 6 years ago and it was frustrating because everything looked familiar, but still seems forgein. It took hours of watching tutorials and looking over practice script to refresh my memory and even then I barely knew anything. Coming up with a concept might have been even more challenging than relearning how to code. I had multiple ideas, but none of them interested me. It took me two days to come up with concept i liked and it took me another day to organize my ideas. Once i got the project rolling and my thoughts on script the project slowly became fun. My idea was to have clusters of pictures from every decade starting with the 1950s to today's football team. I also started with the 1950s because that's when African Americans were granted permission to play college football. I wanted the decades to show how more and more African Americans were joining and playing college football. I wanted the images to show how technology has been improving, how football gear has changed, and how UCLA football has grown over the years. From era to era you see how cameras have been evolving and slowly becoming better and clearer, you also see how uniforms or designed has changed over time, and how equipment improves to keep player safely at a high. I was quite shocked to learn how much you can learn from pictures and i thought it was cool because this photos included football. This overall idea was a lot simpler in my head, but a lot harder to actually code and execute. I wanted to add music to my video, but i couldn't figure out how to add it without a play button. I wanted the music to play automatically as you opened up the site. I also couldn't figure out how to resize the images into the same size, so all my images vary in height and width. It took me awhile to figure out how to link another HTML file to an image, but i believe the trouble was worth it because it makes the overall aesthetics of the project look good. Overall this project was fun even with all the roadblocks. It was not only informative, but it was something I could tie back into myself and my fellow classmates. Even though I wrote a bunch of negatives about this project i 100% would redo it all over again.

  In our modern world the internet has impacted our communications drastically and the technology pioneered before it, which lead up to the internet, also impacted communications in its respected era. Tarleton Gillespie End-to-End article impacted me the most. Gillespie tries to define or elaborate on what the internet is and analyse other people's definitions. Gillespie goes on to say that people like graphic designers, computer programmers, or people whose backgrounds encompassing the internet have no common census or definition on what the internet is. Then Gillespie goes on a rant about how people who have no certification or degree to define the internet came up with the End-to-End theory. Gillespie doesn’t entirely disagree with this theory but he says that the the End-to-End theory is far too simple to define something as broad as the internet. According to Gillespie,” But how did this term come to stand in as an icon for the shape of the Internet, inside of engineering debates and out, such that authoritative claims about the technology's value, purpose, and impact could be built upon it?”(Gillespie, 2006,p. 430) To me this shows that Gillespie is confused by how this simple definition was even considered and from someone like me who took C++ and graphic design in highschool, this definition seems too vague to me as well.
  
 In Tim Wu’s article,”The Master Switch”, Wu talks about how technology is constantly evolving and when people think technology can't get any better than what it is it somehow does and Wu calls these cycles. I agree with Wu, especially as someone who lived in the era of flip phones, were everyone considered sidekicks and blackberrys to be the most technological advances phones at the time. Now living present day we have iphones and samsungs which tower in advancement compared to older flip phones.  Wu also talks about the history of At&t and how later on the company monopolized because of infrastructures they built early on, he talks about the introduction of the first phone and how they made a call to the border during a nation geographic dinner, he talks about Internet protocols, and he talks about different technology cycles throughout the century. 
 
 In James W. Careys Article, “The Case of The Telegraph, Carey goes on to talk about the history of the telegraph and how it reshaped communication. Carey talks about how the telegraph reshaped trade on the railroads and helped create time zones. According to Carey,” The telegraph was the first product—really the foundation—of the electrical goods industry and thus the first of the science.”(James W. Carey, 2009 , p.2) I agree with Carey, because i believe without the telegraph people wouldn't have been pushed to advance on technology and develop something like the phone. The telegraph is the starting point of electrical goods and it also helps prove Tim Wu’s points of technological cycles.
